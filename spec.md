I want to understand how to implement two-way sync between a claude-flow swarm of agents and github issues/prs.

I want my swarm to automatically log its goal, its progress & its results to a github issue/pr corresponding with its goal (like a bug fix or feature request).

I want to be able to communicate with the swarm by commenting on the github issue.

I don't want to reinvent the wheel. I understand that ruvnet is already using a github integration to sync swarms with github issues/prs. I understand that he is using hooks to sync agent context at certain stages like before and after task completion.

Deep reasearch @ruvnet-claude-flow and teach me how this might work
